   • Go to Settings → App Passwords
   • Click "Add App Password"
   • Give it a name (e.g., "Chrome Extension")
   • Copy the generated password (format: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx)
   • IMPORTANT: Save this password - you can't view it again!

3. CONFIGURE THE EXTENSION
   • Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
   • Enter your Bluesky handle (e.g., yourname.bsky.social)
   • Paste the app password you just created
   • Click "Login to Bluesky"

4. USE IT!
   • Visit Twitter/X (twitter.com or x.com)
   • You'll see "Post to Bluesky" buttons under tweets
   • Click any button to cross-post that tweet to Bluesky
   • Done! The tweet will appear on your Bluesky feed

NOTES:
• Your credentials are stored securely in Chrome
• The extension only posts when you click the button
• Up to 4 images per tweet are supported
• Posts are limited to 300 characters (Bluesky's limit)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
